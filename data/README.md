Cell Phone Call Records

These cell phone call records cover a ten day period in June 2006 and should give us some idea about the Catalano social 
network.  We were able to narrow the dataset down to about 400 unique cell phones during this period, and we would like 
to use visual analytics approaches to help us understand this data.  The data set includes records with the following 
fields:

From:  Identifier for the calling cell
To:  Identifier for the receiving cell
Datetime:  a yyyymmdd hhmm format date and time
Duration:  duration of the call in seconds
Cell Tower:  Location of the call origination cell tower

Our mapping of the cell tower locations is not precise, but we have included a map of Isla del Sue√±o with approximate 
coverages of the towers in a gridded form.  

Many of the cell phone records have false names associated with the accounts, so we have provided identifiers instead of 
names for the callers and receivers.   We have medium confidence that Ferdinando Catalano is identifier 200.   Close 
relatives and associate that he would be calling include David Vidro, Juan Vidro, Jorge Vidro, and Estaban Catalano.  We 
believe Ferdinando would call brother Estaban most frequently.  We also believe that David Vidro coordinates high level 
Paraiso activities.
